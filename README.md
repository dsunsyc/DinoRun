# DinoRun
A 3D take on the popular browser game. Intended to act as an environment to 
train a deep reinforcement agent to play the game.

Gameplay example:

## Installation:
Follow instructions on Panda3Ds page to install panda3d version 1.10.8 (not 
tested on 1.10.9). Then just clone the repo to get the code and assets. I would 
recommend using their installers for Windows/macOS rather than Ubuntu as I had 
an array of issues for launching the GUI.

## Goal:
Learn about 3D environments and modelling, as well as setting up a basic 
environment to do tests with some reinforcement learning models.

## TODO:
- Increase complexity of game (increasing speed and variety of different obstacles)

- Integrate reinforcement learning and train agent to play the game
